# Libft Project - My First Library at 42 School

## Introduction

Welcome to my Libft project at 42 School. This foundational project marked the beginning of my coding journey, immersing me in the intricacies of the C programming language and low-level data manipulation. The primary goal of Libft was to recreate a series of standard C library functions, along with additional utility functions that will serve me throughout my programming career at 42. This project was my first step in building my own reusable library, a critical tool for future programming challenges.

## Objectives

- **Understanding the inner workings of standard C library functions**: Recreating these functions allowed me not just to use these essential tools effectively, but also to understand their mechanics.
- **Developing C programming skills**: Through Libft, I honed my proficiency in C, especially in memory management, string processing, and data structures.
- **Creating a personal library**: This library will grow with more complex functions over time, becoming a valuable asset for my future projects.

## Implemented Functions

The project is divided into several parts, each with a set of functions to implement:

- **Part 1 - Libc Functions**: I recreated standard C library functions such as `strlen`, `strdup`, `strcpy`, `strcat`, and memory manipulation functions like `malloc` and `free`.
- **Part 2 - Additional Functions**: I implemented functions that are not included in the libc or are more complex, such as list manipulation.
- **Bonus (optional)**: To push the project further, I added functions for other data structures or advanced functionalities.

## General Instructions

- My code is written in C following the 42 School Norm.
- All functions are prefixed with `ft_` to avoid conflicts with the standard libraries.
- The project is submitted with a `Makefile` that compiles the library and includes the rules `all`, `clean`, `fclean`, and `re`.
- I ensured the code is clear, efficient, and optimized to avoid redundancy.

## How to Use Libft

1. Clone my git repository containing the libft.
2. Compile the library using the `Makefile`: type `make` in the terminal at the root of the project.
3. Include the library in your C projects by adding `#include "libft.h"` at the top of your source files and compiling with `-L. -lft`.

## Contribution

This project is personal and reflects my understanding of basic programming concepts in C. However, I welcome any suggestions for improvement or bug fixes through issues or pull requests, following the 42 School's rules.
